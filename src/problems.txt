Problems:
Routes extend screen and add scroll bar when hovered over due to width:100%
Routes divs are too wide, so hovering over non-text still italicizes
Icons in about section are blue when hovered over
Links in work section are blue. setting <a> tag css does not work. Only classes work for some reason.
Grab a resume doesn't work when resume is passed as a parameter into a component.
Can't get routes to stay italicized when selected.
Animating the justify to right
How do I shrink the blue box?
